# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Fractional Width Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using fractional widths (e.g., `w-1/2`) within Tailwind CSS flexbox containers. The issue arises when the fractional widths don't seem to distribute the space correctly.

## Bug Description

When two divs with `w-1/2` are placed side by side in a flex container, one might expect them to occupy exactly half the available width each. However, this doesn't always happen, especially if there's other content affecting the container's dimensions.

## Solution

The problem often stems from the implicit `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` properties. Setting these explicitly to `0` ensures the divs maintain their fractional width without unwanted shrinking or expanding.  Additionally, ensuring the parent container has the correct width to prevent unexpected behaviors can resolve the issue. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.  Observe the unequal spacing of the divs.
3. Then, compare to `bugSolution.html` to see the resolution.
